Spark Sketch
A simple Drawing Pad!

Spark Sketch is an online paint app with social network sharing enabled. Every
paint saved by registered users is saved in a folder and attached to that user
in the database. An already drawn paint can be extend by any user, saved on
the server and attached to the user who extended it.

Requires:
	* PHP 5.3.x
	* MySQL 5.x
	* At least 100 MB space

How it works:
Unregistered users have access to paints created by other users, shared by
users, a demo page, where they can test the software, a register page,
a login page and a password recovery page.

Registred users can draw paintings, store, share or extend them. Also each user
can modify some personal data or delete his account.
